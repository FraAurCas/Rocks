Materials have density which dictates pieces being displaced. More dense Materials will displace less dense materials. The order of density is Water<Dirt<Rock.
Water and dirt will spread and pile somewhat realistically. Rock will fall and freeze in place when it contacts other rock pieces.
Right-click will start spawning multiple pieces in one place, middle-click will delete Water and Rock.
